# üö® AZURE COOKIES CRITICAL FIX

## **ISSUE ANALYSIS**

Based on the Azure deployment logs, there are several critical issues with the cookies system:

### **üîç Problems Identified:**

1. **Environment Variable Size Limit Exceeded**

   - `YTDLP_COOKIES_CONTENT` is 37,798 bytes (37KB)
   - Azure App Service limit is 32,768 bytes (32KB)
   - Content is being truncated at the limit

2. **Invalid Cookie Content After Decoding**

   - After URL decoding: 33,700 bytes
   - Contains only Netscape header, no actual cookies
   - Validation shows: "0 YouTube domains", "0 valid cookie entries"

3. **Missing Essential Authentication Cookies**
   - Missing: SID, HSID, SSID, APISID, SAPISID
   - These are required for YouTube authentication

## **üîß IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED**

### **Fix 1: Environment Variable Size Issue**

The Azure environment variable truncation is causing cookie data loss.

**Solutions:**

1. **Move to Azure Key Vault** (recommended)
2. **Use file-based cookies** with Azure storage
3. **Compress cookies data** before storing

### **Fix 2: Cookie Content Validation**

The current validation is failing because the truncated/corrupted data doesn't contain valid cookies.

### **Fix 3: Enhanced Error Handling**

The system needs better error detection and fallback mechanisms.

## **üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION**

The fixes are implemented in the server.js improvements below.
