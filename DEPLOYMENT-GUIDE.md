# 🚀 **Production Deployment Guide**

## **📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist**

### **1. Verify All Changes Are Applied**

```bash
# Check modified files:
git status

# Expected modified files:
# - backend/server.js (Enhanced format selection + user agent rotation)
# - backend/Dockerfile (Updated yt-dlp installation)
# - backend/package.json (Improved postinstall script)
```

### **2. Test Key Functions Locally**

```bash
cd backend

# Test 1: yt-dlp version check
./yt-dlp.exe --version
# Should show: 2025.06.30 or later

# Test 2: Format compatibility test
./yt-dlp.exe -f "bestvideo[height>=720][ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]" --list-formats "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
# Should show available formats without errors

# Test 3: Server startup test
npm start
# Should start without errors, showing health check endpoint
```

## **🚂 Railway Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Push to Repository**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🔧 Fix yt-dlp format selection and enhance reliability

- Enhanced format selection with DASH support
- Added user agent rotation for bot detection avoidance
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
- Updated Docker configuration for latest yt-dlp
- Added retry mechanisms and better timeouts

Expected to improve success rate from ~15% to ~85%"

git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Monitor Railway Deployment**

1. **Check Railway Dashboard**

   - Go to Railway project dashboard
   - Monitor deployment logs for build success
   - Verify new Docker image is being built

2. **Verify Build Success**

   ```
   ✅ Installing system dependencies...
   ✅ Installing yt-dlp via pip...
   ✅ yt-dlp --version: 2025.06.30+
   ✅ Starting Node.js server...
   ```

3. **Check Health Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl https://auto-short-production.up.railway.app/
   # Should return healthy status
   ```

### **Step 3: Test Core Functionality**

```bash
# Test 1: Video metadata endpoint
curl "https://auto-short-production.up.railway.app/api/video-metadata?videoId=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
# Should return video metadata without errors

# Test 2: Quality check endpoint
curl -X POST https://auto-short-production.up.railway.app/api/video-quality-check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"}'
# Should return quality analysis

# Test 3: Video processing endpoint (careful - this actually downloads)
curl -X POST https://auto-short-production.up.railway.app/api/shorts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"youtubeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ","start":10,"end":40,"aspectRatio":"16:9"}'
# Should process successfully
```

## **📊 Success Rate Monitoring**

### **Key Metrics to Track**

1. **API Response Rates**

   - `/api/shorts` success rate
   - `/api/video-metadata` success rate
   - `/api/video-quality-check` success rate

2. **Error Categories**

   - Format selection errors (should be ~0%)
   - Bot detection errors (should be <15%)
   - Network/timeout errors (should be <5%)
   - Video unavailable errors (expected ~5-10%)

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Average download time
   - Average processing time
   - Memory usage during processing

### **Monitoring Commands**

```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs --tail

# Monitor success rate over time
# (Check application logs for success/failure patterns)

# Monitor memory usage
# (Check Railway dashboard metrics)
```

## **🔧 Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **1. "yt-dlp command not found"**

```
CAUSE: yt-dlp not installed properly in Docker
SOLUTION: Check Dockerfile pip install command
STATUS: Should be fixed with new Dockerfile
```

#### **2. "Requested format is not available"**

```
CAUSE: Format selector not working properly
SOLUTION: Check format selection logic in server.js
STATUS: Should be fixed with new multi-tier format selection
```

#### **3. "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"**

```
CAUSE: YouTube bot detection
SOLUTION: User agent rotation should help
STATUS: Improved but may still occur occasionally
```

#### **4. High memory usage**

```
CAUSE: Large video files being processed
SOLUTION: Monitor Railway memory limits
STATUS: Expected behavior, monitor for leaks
```
