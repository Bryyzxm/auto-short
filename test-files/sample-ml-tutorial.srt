00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Welcome to our AI tutorial series. Today we'll be learning about machine learning fundamentals.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn automatically.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,800
There are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,900
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. For example, showing a computer thousands of cat photos.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,200
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labels. It's like finding hidden connections.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Reinforcement learning learns through trial and error, much like how humans learn to play games.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Popular machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,200
Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and can solve complex problems.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,800
Applications of machine learning include image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,200
To get started with machine learning, you need data, a problem to solve, and the right tools.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Popular tools include Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,800
The future of machine learning includes automated machine learning and explainable AI.
